    <h1>ü•ê Croissants: A little bit of History</h1>
    <p>
      Croissants are a delicious buttery and flaky pastry made from French
      yeast-leavened laminated dough and is a style of viennoiserie pastries. It
      was named for its crecent shape, inspired by the Austrian kipferl. The
      kipferl dates back to the 13th century and comes in various shapes and
      sizes. The croissant was popularized in France by Marie Antoinette, after
      requesting the royal bakers to replicate her favorite treat from her
      Austiran homeland. Then in approximately in 1839, Austrian artillery
      officer, August Zang, founded a Viennese bakery in Paris. Croissants have
      been a favorite all across the globe ever since.

      Authentic croissants require a methodical approach and lots of patience.
      Though the ingredients are simple, the process is long and requires lots
      of attention. Over time though, many have altered the directions and even
      the ingredients to reduce the time required to make them. They are great
      as a sweet or savory dish! My personal favorite savory croissant dish is
      light chicken salad servered on a croissant. I also enjoy a delicious
      chocolate croissant as pictured below! Whats your favorite croissant dish?
